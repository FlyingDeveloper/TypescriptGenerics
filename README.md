TypescriptGenerics
==================

This is a project that I'm using to play around with the new generics functionality in Typescript.  I haven't
spent much time thinking about Typescript, and had honestly kind of written it off, but when I heard that generics
were coming, I had to check it out.  I have to admit, I think that this makes the language pretty cool.
